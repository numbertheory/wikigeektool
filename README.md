wikigeektool
============

PHP scripts that output the title and plain text from the Wikipedia (English) Featured Article of the day (for the current day).  The script strips out wiki links and just displays the text.

You can use them with GeekTool to get random facts delivered to your desktop daily.  GeekTool is available for free in the Mac App Store.
